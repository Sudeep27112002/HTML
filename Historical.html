                <p class="card-text">Chola Temples, built during the Chola dynasty's rule in South India (9th to 13th centuries), are a remarkable architectural and artistic legacy.

The Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur, an UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a prime example, featuring a towering vimana (temple tower) and intricate sculptures. Other notable Chola temples include the Airavatesvara Temple in Darasuram and the Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple.
